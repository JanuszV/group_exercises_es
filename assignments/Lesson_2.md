IF NOT STATED OTHERWISE THEN:
- You can use any programming language of your choice, along with any addons that make your life easier.
- All solutions can be posted as functions or separate programs.
- Try to refrain from searching for pre-existing solutions. If you're unsure how to solve a problem, don't search for 'how to print *'Hello world!'*'; instead, look for more specific information, such as 'How to print text in a my language?' and then use the knwoledge you aquired. 
- If a task seems challenging or impossible in your chosen language, don't hesitate to reach out for help or patiently await the next exercise.



Please complete the following tasks either as separate functions or by running them consecutively within a single program:

1. Accept a list of comma-separated numbers as a string input and convert them into an array in your language's format. Then output the complete array, first and last index values.
2. Take a string as input, check if a file with that name exists in the current directory, and output its extension.
3. For an integer input n, display an equation in the following format: 'n + nn + nnn + nnnn = m', where m is the sum of the four created numbers.
4. Calculate the number of days between two dates.
5. Given three input integers i, j, and k, calculate a solution for the following equation: 'i/2 * j^2 - k = m', where m is the solution. If i=j=k, then triple the value of m.
6. Accept a string and an integer n as input, display the string n times. If the length of the string is less than 2, then display the output twice.
7. Check if input number is even or odd.
8. Given two lists, print all values from the first list that are not present in the second list.
    
    Test samples:  
    First: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    Second: [3, 5, 6, 7]  
    Output: 1, 2, 4  

    First: ['apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'grape']  
    Second: ['banana', 'kiwi', 'grape']  
    Output: 'apple', 'orange'  

    First: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]  
    Second: [5, 10, 15, 20]  
    Output: 30, 40, 50  

    First: ['dog', 'cat', 'horse', 'rabbit']  
    Second: []  
    Output: 'dog', 'cat', 'horse', 'rabbit'  

    First: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    Second: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    Output: []  

9. Round the input number just like in your school years!
    
    Test samples:  
    Input   => Rounded Value  
    3.4     => 3  
    9.1     => 9  
    2.5     => 3  
    6.75    => 7  
    11.3    => 11  
    15.6    => 16  
    23.9    => 24  
    44.7    => 45  
    72.8    => 73  
    89.2    => 89  
    95.5    => 96  

10. Round the input number using bankers rounding('.5' goes to nearest even number).

    Test samples:  
    Input    => Rounded Value  
    3.4      => 3  
    9.1      => 9  
    2.5      => 2  
    6.75     => 7  
    11.3     => 11  
    15.6     => 16  
    23.9     => 24  
    44.7     => 45  
    72.8     => 72  
    89.2     => 89  
    95.5     => 96
