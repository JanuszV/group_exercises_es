IF NOT STATED OTHERWISE THEN:
- You can use any programming language of your choice, along with any addons that make your life easier.
- All solutions can be posted as functions or separate programs.
- Try to refrain from searching for pre-existing solutions. If you're unsure how to solve a problem, don't search for 'how to print *'Hello world!'*'; instead, look for more specific information, such as 'How to print text in a my language?' and then use the knwoledge you aquired. 
- If a task seems challenging or impossible in your chosen language, don't hesitate to reach out for help or patiently await the next exercise.



Please complete the following tasks either as separate functions or by running them consecutively within a single program:

1. Sort three integers without using loops, if statements, or built-in sort functions.

2. Print all numbers from 0 to n vertically.
    
    Test samples:  
    Input   => Output  
    15      =>              1 1 1 1 1  
                1 2 3 4 ... 1 2 3 4 5  
    56      =>              3 3 3     5 5 5  
                1 2 3 4 ... 2 3 4 ... 4 5 6  

3. Perfect square! Check if reversing the digits of the area of a perfectly squared number also results in a perfect square.
    
    Test samples:  
    Input   =>   Squared   =>   Reversed Value   =>     Square root         => Output
     10     =>     100     =>        001         =>     (1^(0.5)) = 1       =>  True
      4     =>      16     =>         61         =>    (61^(0.5)) ≈ 7.8102  =>  False 

4. Translate a number from:

    - Decimal to binary and hexadecimal,
    - Binary to decimal and hexadecimal,
    - Hexadecimal to binary and decimal.
    Start by giving the user the choice of the number system the input is written in.
    If you feel confident, try to create a simple system to detect the type of number system; be creative!

5. Find the smallest positive integer which ends with n, is divisible by n, and the sum of its digits equals n.
