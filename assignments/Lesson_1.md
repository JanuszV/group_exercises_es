IF NOT STATED OTHERWISE THEN:
- You can use any programming language of your choice, along with any addons that make your life easier.
- All solutions can be posted as functions or separate programs.
- Try to refrain from searching for pre-existing solutions. If you're unsure how to solve a problem, don't search for 'how to print *'Hello world!'*'; instead, look for more specific information, such as 'How to print text in a my language?' and then use the knwoledge you aquired. 
- If a task seems challenging or impossible in your chosen language, don't hesitate to reach out for help or patiently await the next exercise.


This first assignment will be quite simple, so we can warm up a little bit.

Please complete the following tasks either as separate functions or by running them consecutively within a single program:

1. Display the version of your programming language.
2. Display the current time and date.
3. Create a *"Hello, World!"* message where letters are displayed in the colors of the rainbow.
4. Calculate the area of a circle using a user-provided radius as input.
5. Take user inputs for their first and last names, then reverse the order of the names, add a space between them, and display the result as a single output.
