IF NOT STATED OTHERWISE THEN:
- You can use any programming language of your choice, along with any addons that make your life easier.
- All solutions can be posted as functions or separate programs.
- Try to refrain from searching for pre-existing solutions. If you're unsure how to solve a problem, don't search for 'how to print *'Hello world!'*'; instead, look for more specific information, such as 'How to print text in a my language?' and then use the knwoledge you aquired. 
- If a task seems challenging or impossible in your chosen language, don't hesitate to reach out for help or patiently await the next exercise.



Please complete the following tasks either as separate functions or by running them consecutively within a single program:  

1. Take letters as input and print all possible strings without duplication. For example, if the input is "abc", the output would be "abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba." The same output values would be true for the input "ccabbb".  

2. Take a text as input, create a list of words, and count each word separately. For example:
    <pre>
    Input: "Hello world! Hello universe!"
    Word Count:
    Hello: 2
    world: 1
    universe: 1 
    </pre>  
3. Add two positive integers without using the "+" operator.  

4. Create a function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to the given input n.
